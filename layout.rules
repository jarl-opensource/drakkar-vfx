## Top-Level Paths

- bin/gui.rs    = entry for gpui-based editor
- bin/viewer.rs = entry for Bevy-based viewer
- gui/*         = editor app
- viewer/*      = viewer app
- shared/*      = shared code like client/server protocol between viewer and gui

## Editor App (gui) Paths

- styling/**/*.rs – commonly used colors, fontsand icons.
- models/**/*.rs – basic flat rust structures representing objects that editor will be manipulating.
- expr/**/*.rs – expression parser and other utilities. Mostly mimics Bevy Hanabi expression structure.
- primitives/**/*.rs – basic raw input components for things like text input, numbers inputs, slider, color picker etc.
- facets/**/*.rs – higher-level editor components combining multiple primitives for editing rust types or editor model types.
- asset_editor/**/*.rs – asset editor panel.
- file_browser/**/*.rs – file browser panel.
- utils/**/*.rs – various utils for scm, text, fs etc.
- blocks.rs – blocks combining facets and labels into even higher level primitives.
- section.rs – expandable section with multiple blocks.
- client.rs – socket clicket for communicating with viewer app.
- server_wrapper.rs – wrapper for controlling server (viewer) app process.
- app.rs – gpui app implementation.
- **/events.rs – gpui event types and emitter immplementations for module components.
